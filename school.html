<p>After graduating high school, I attended Belmont University for a semester. Once realizing I was wasting time, I returned home and didn't attend classes for a semester. I was accepted into IUPUI starting out as a physics major. It had always interested me but became very hard, with a monetary payout to be not that big. That's why I am now doing CS with my math minor. Most my classes transferred, I'll be done quicker, and computers are the way to go </p>
